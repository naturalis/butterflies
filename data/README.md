The Excel spreadsheet Tables\_EU\_traits.xlsx, sheet SupplTable1
contains the input data for the comparative analysis. However, the
Red List assessment is given as two-letter codes, whereas the 
manuscript discusses that this should be recoded into a binomial
state such that any threat level upwards of Near threatened is 
coded as 1, and below it as 0, i.e.:

- CR = Critically endangered = 1
- EN = Endangered = 1
- VU = Vulnerable = 1
- NT = Near threatened = 1
- LC = Least concern = 0
- NA = "Not applicable" = 0
